# Top 5 Most Overlooked Female Artists in Art History



In preparation for this article, I conducted a little research among friends who are, let’s say, moderate to lukewarm art lovers, asking them to list some of their favourite female artists from history. My findings were overwhelmingly conclusive, although admittedly also statistically insignificant. So do take them with a pinch of salt. 

It seems though the only two women to have successfully made it in the general public’s cultural awareness are Frida Kahlo and Georgia O’Keefe. 

To be perfectly honest, some other names were included in the survey responses. Names like Marina Abramović or Yayoi Kusama. For the purposes of this super scientific research, I decided to not take them into account as they are not historic enough. In other words, they would be considered way too contemporary in the context of this list. I was after names from the Western Art History canon, history being one of the operative words. I also chose to stick to what I know best, which is predominantly Western Art. I would love to see someone far more competent explore this topic from a different cultural viewpoint!

I asked my respondents to list some men as well. Unsurprisingly, they were all able to name at least 3/4 of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles team, along with some fauvists, impressionists, cubists, “the one with the ear” and so on. I was particularly intrigued by a respondent, who was aware of George Braque (not judging, he is a great painter!) but could not recall a single woman.

So this list covers female artists who *could have or should have been* another Leonardo, Picasso or Monet - depending on their era. However, they *are not*, as the system has clearly been hijacked by the Guys with Beards Only Club for centuries. It is not that these women are not very well known and discussed in academic circles - this list does contain some big names. My point is, if these female artists are not so ‘niche’ why are they not included in the basic art history knowledge of the average person? Average in the sense of academic education on this specific topic in question, of course.

Without further ado, here are the top 5 female artists that people should know of, in my view the same way they know of Michelangelo. It goes without saying, that this list could go on, or be completely different. Please accept the subjectiveness, as I am admittedly focusing on my personal favourites.

## 1. Sofonisba Anguissola  (1532 -1625)
![Sofonisba Anguissola](https://i.imgur.com/XCsNJGE.jpg)


Sofonisba Anguissola was an Italian Late Renaissance painter, one of the first women to receive training and education in the fine arts. She was a portrait painter, working all around Italy and Spain, perhaps most notably in Madrid as an official court painter of King Phillip II. 

Her success was made possible by her father, who came from an aristocratic background and encouraged all his children, not only boys, to pursue higher education. What also perhaps helped, is the fact that the great Michelangelo himself recognised young Sofonisba's talent and decided to offer his guidance. 

Her work, especially the self-portraits, reflect a stance on the role of women in art.. In the context of visual arts at the time, women were considered to be passive objects and men the active creators. In her portraits, Sofonisba shows herself taking on an active role of a painter or instrument player, refuting the idea of being reduced to an object.

Also, does anyone else think it would be a good idea to have a tortoise called Sofonisba in the Ninja Turtle universe?

## 2. Artemisia Gentileschi (1593 - 1656)

*Trigger warning: mention of sexual violence ahead*

Artemisia Lomi or Gentileschi was an Italian Baroque painter, one of the most accomplished ones of her era. Initially painting in the style of Carravaggio, she became famous for her ability to depict dramatic scenes, to achieve naturalism in human figure and also her skilful use of colour. 

As is the tragic reality of many women, Artemisia was not spared the experience of sexual violence. She was a victim of assault, perpetrated by Agosstino Tassi, a fellow painter. But we have reasons to believe that the artist used her creative energy as an outlet to deal with trauma in her own expressive way. 

One of her most iconic pieces Judith Slaying Holofernes [Judith Slaying Holofernes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Slaying_Holofernes_(Artemisia_Gentileschi,_Naples)) portrays a scene from the Old Testament, where an Israeli heroine Judith decapitates general Holofernes with the help of a maid while he is passed out drunk. Many academics interpret this piece as an expression of female strength as well as Artemisia’s artistic “revenge” against Tassi. 

We can only speculate whether this painting could be related to the artist’s personal hardships in any way. It is still one of the strongest, technically excelling and most painfully expressive paintings from the Baroque era. Baroque paintings do tend to be very dramatic, but this one just feels very different. It’s raw and real, filled with genuine expressions of livid experiences. But I guess you need to see it (in Naples) to believe it!

## 3. Rosa Bonheur (1822 - 1899)

Rosa Bonheur was a French painter in realist style, mainly known for her animal paintings. She was incredibly knowledgeable about animal anatomy, which resulted in skillfully accurate and beautiful  paintings of horses and cattle, as seen in her painting [Ploughing in the Nivernais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploughing_in_the_Nivernais) and many more. 

Her professional accomplishments and her ability to (rightfully) penetrate the artistic space typically reserved for men are undoubtedly respectable. However, it was not only in her profession that she defied the norms and pushed the boundaries. 

Bonheur refused to express gender in the ‘right’ way according to society at the time. She wore traditionally male clothing and participated in *shockingly* indelicate non lady-like activities such as smoking and hunting. Although never fully confirmed because of prevalent homophobic views of the 19th century, there is substantial evidence that Bonheur had a preference for women and had two long term female partners with whom she lived. 

Rosa Bohneur represented not only a successful female artist but also a successful queer artist in times where both of these identities were silenced, denied or questioned. And she did so unapologetically.

## 4. Camille Claudel (1864 - 1943)

Camille Claudel was a French artist and one of the most important figures in the Modern sculpture movement. She began expressing interest in sculpting from a very early age and soon was noticed for her talent, which allowed her to progress in formal training. 

Her work was original, sensual, fluid and thought provoking. She stood out from the crowd due to her ability to convey symbolism and hidden emotion. This caught the attention of Auguste Rodin, who was much older and already established as one of the leading sculptors at the time. What started off as a teacher-student relationship quickly developed into a whirlwind intimate relationship with many red flags *(Britney Spears' Toxic plays in the background)*.

Claudel seriously struggled with mental illness, causing her artistic presence to fade before getting re-discovered later on. Her life sparked many discussions among art historians, especially in the context of feminism. Her struggles and eccentricities were viewed as unwanted behaviour of a hysterical woman, something that could be interpreted as a sign of genius in a man.

## 5. Mary Cassat (1844 - 1926)
![Mary Cassat](https://i.imgur.com/a2lX9fU.jpg)


Mary Cassat was an American painter and one of the three most well-known female Impressionists, at least according to a man called Gustave Geffroy, who dubbed Mary, Marie Bracquemond, and Berthe Morisot “Les Trois Grandes Dames” (The Three Great Ladies). 
Cassat was born into a relatively progressive family, at least in the context of her time. She received education and training, which arguably prompted her to develop a strong political stance on many issues concerning women's rights. She represented the “New Woman” who was actively engaged with feminist movements of the 19th century. Her feminist views translated into artwork as well. She often depicted women. Women in every-day situations, women who do not seem special. 
She removed the male gaze or objectification from the picture entirely, her paintings do not treat women as mere objects. She injects deeper meaning into every single subject of her paintings. My personal favourites are [The Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Cassatt#/media/File:Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Child%27s_Bath_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) or [Reading “Le Figaro”](https://www.marycassatt.org/Reading-Le-Figaro-1878.html). If you look closely you can see how much depth, strength, and authenticity she gives to these women who may be perceived as ordinary at the very first glance.
